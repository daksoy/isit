The 2013 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory will be
held in Istanbul, Turkey, from Sunday July 7th through Friday July
12th, 2013.  Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey and the cultural,
economic, and financial center of the country.  The city is a bridge
between two continents as well as between cultures and traditions. In
its long history, Istanbul has served as the capital of the Eastern
Roman and Ottoman empires, whose legacy still survives in the city’s
architecture and culture.

Interested authors are encouraged to submit previously unpublished
contributions from a broad range of topics related to information
theory, including (but not limited to) the following areas:

<table id="subjects">
          <tr><td>Coding theory and practice</td><td>Communication theory</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Compression</td><td>Cryptography and data security</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Detection and estimation</td><td>Information theory and statistics</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Information theory in networks</td><td>Multi-terminal information theory</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Pattern recognition and learning</td><td>Quantum information theory</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Sequences and complexity</td><td>Shannon theory</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Signal processing</td><td>Source coding</td></tr>
</table>

Researchers working on novel applications of information theory are
especially encouraged to submit original findings.  Submitted papers
should be of sufficient detail for review by experts in the field. The
submission deadline is *January 13, 2013*. Detailed information
on paper submission, technical program, tutorials, travel, social
programs, and travel grants will be announced on the ISIT 2013 web
site: *http://www.isit2013.org*
